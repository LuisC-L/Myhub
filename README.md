## Introduction
Hi, my name is **Luis Carlos Lopez**. I'm a student at **UniversitÃ© Laval** in QuÃ©bec City.  
This project is created to practice and learn on my own.

MyHub is a personal hub made with **Laravel** that brings all of my web projects into one place.  
The goal is to have **easy access** to all my projects and keep them organized.

I created this project to:
- Use technologies that aren't actively used in my studies.
